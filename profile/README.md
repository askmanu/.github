## Get always up to date documentation

askmanu is the AI copilot that has one focus: keeping your documentation up to date.

### 🚀 How it works
After you install the **askmanu** bot, we parse every supported code file and save stats about the file: how documented it is, how well the docs are, etc

#### Pro-active PRs
askmanu pro-actively creates PRs with new reference documentation for you to review.
As soon as those get merged it starts working on the next one.

No need to create issues and, write description and call on **askmanu**

### 📝 What type of documentation?
Right now, askmanu is focused on reference documentation. Having that is a strong foundation to build upon.

We will very soon add the ability to update and create MD files (like the ones in the `/docs` folder).

### 🔒 Privacy
askmanu doesn't store your code. We pull it from github every time we process it. We only share the code with the model provider according to our [Privacy Policy](https://docs.askmanu.co/legal/privacy)
